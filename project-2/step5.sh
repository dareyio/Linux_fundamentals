You must be really excited to start getting your hands dirty.
There is a lot of projects ahead, so without any delay, let us get started.
As you kick off your career in DevOps, you will soon realise that everything you 
will be doing as a DevOps engineer is around software, websites, applications etc. 
And, there are different stack of technologies that make different solutions possible.
These stack of technologies are regarded as WEB STACKS. Examples of Web Stacks include LAMP, LEMP, 
MEAN, and MERN stacks. As you proceed in your journey, you will be required to understand and implement
all of these technology stacks. Lets have a short close up on what a technology stack is.
WARNING: Most of the things you will be doing at the early days may not mean a lot to you. 
Sometimes it may seem like you are just copying and pasting. That is absolutely fine. 
We want some concepts to begin to register in your sub-conscious mind, and without you realising it, 
you are building up skills. Although, there are certain traps that will require you to troubleshoot 
along the way. So watch out for them in all your project implementations.
After successful completion of PBL projects 1 to 4, you will be able to achieve the following:
1. Become very confident on the Linux Terminal
2. Deepen your understanding of Web Stacks and familiarity between the differences between the different
   Web Technology stacks such as LAMP, LEMP, MEAN, and MERN stacks
3. Solid Linux administration skills in Storage management, NFS, troubleshooting, and basic networking.
4. Basic knowledge of AWS platform and components used to host a Website of various Web stacks.
5. Being able to work with Linux requires the ability to work outside the level of your present 
   knowledge.

It means that in the real world, you will be faced with tasks that you have never worked on before, 
and with Google search and its results, you can achieve a lot. Thanks to “Google!!!”. It is one of 
the essential skills you will need to develop - constructing a correct search query for Google to 
process and having the ability to comb through resources that interpretes into a potential solution for 
you is a great skill to have as well.

In order to start the projects you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.
AWS is the biggest Cloud Service Provider and it offers a free tier account that we are going to leverage
for our projects.
Do not focus too much on AWS itself right now, there will be a proper Cloud introduction and configuration
projects later in our course.
Right now, all we need to know is that AWS can provide us with a free virtual server called EC2
(Elastic Compute Cloud) for our needs.
Spinning up a new EC2 instance (an instance of a virtual server) is only a matter of a few clicks.
Watch  videos on below to get yourself set up.

1. AWS account setup and Provisioning an Ubuntu Server
2. Connecting to your EC2 Instance
